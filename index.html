    <h2>What I'm Currently Working On</h2>
    <p>I'm focused on mastering web development fundamentals. This site documents what I learn, how I apply it, and
        <em>how I refine my skills through practice</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm exploring how different tags behave. I review <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        tutorials and experiment during quiet hours to stay focused.</p>

    <h2>I'm Ready to Learn HTML</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>

    <h3>Outline of My Daily Workflow</h3>
    <p>Let me tell you how I
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...explore new HTML tags and semantic structure.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...balance learning with real-world practice.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...reference trusted docs like <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr> to
        deepen my understanding.

    <h2>What I'm Currently Working On</h2>
    <p>I'm focused on mastering web development fundamentals. This site documents what I learn, how I apply it, and
        <em>how I refine my skills through practice</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm exploring how different tags behave. I review <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        tutorials and experiment during quiet hours to stay focused.</p>

    <h3>What I've Discovered So Far</h3>
    <p>Dave Gray's tutorials simplify complex topics into clear, actionable steps that make learning feel approachable
        and practical.</p>
    <p>freeCodeCamp offers structured challenges that keep me engaged and focused on building real-world skills. To
